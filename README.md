Movie Genre Classification.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we convert text data into numerical representations using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings. These transformed features are then used to train classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately categorize movies into genres.

Project Overview:

Data Loading: Import the dataset containing movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including removing noise, handling missing values, and standardizing the format.

Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of genres and other relevant features to gain insights into the dataset.

Data Cleaning: Further clean the text data by removing stopwords and applying WordNetLemmatizer for better feature extraction.

Feature Extraction: Transform the textual information into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Model Training: Implement and train multiple classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM on the extracted features.

Model Testing: Test the trained models on new samples to evaluate their performance and make predictions.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation results for predicting movie genres.
